### Detailed Feedback

#### Tutor: Andy
**Feedback Source**: Audit Report
<br>
**Date**: week3-4
**Feedback**:
- More description as to what this chat bot actually does. What data is drawing from? What are the kinds of questions it might be expected to answer?why it exists and the problems it solves. What does this do that is superior to just a standard search?

- Your landing page is very basic and lacks many of the common resources I would expect to see. I will highlight these section by section but there needs to be a major uplift in the quality and volume of your documentation. Please address as many of these as you can by the next lesson then we will go over your mark line by line and try to identify all the areas of improvement.

- At the moment, I am very concerned that the project has failed to effectively kick-off and that your team has a clear plan for the semester. We need to remedy that ASAP.

- Your meeting notes seem just to be agendas, nothing of substance is captured on what happens inside the meetings. You need a lot more detail than this, as it is its hard to tell what you are doing as a result of these meetings. I should be able to go into your meeting logs and see what is discussed, what decisions are made, and what the actionable outcomes of those decisions are.

- Your decision log is not up to scratch. This needs to be a spreadsheet with decision name, decision description, date, actions etc. Right now you aren’t capturing decisions properly and this must change immediately.

- Your task tracking (via issues) is barely existent. When tasks are done there is often no commenting or description on what was done. There should be dozens of tasks on a typical project and you guys have like 5. You need granular task definition with good quality descriptions. Right now the overwhelming impression your task tracking gives is that you guys aren’t sure how to start and you’re kind of dusting around the edges of that.

- I like that you have a team page, but there’s nothing there about who the team members are or what their skills/specialisations are. This needs content. You should have clear definition of roles as well, which I can’t seem to see.

- Your issues tracking gives me little if any sense of what individuals are doing or how you are functioning as a team.

- There seems to be no mechanism for weekly time tracking that I can see. This is a requirement.

- Without meeting notes, I can’t see how you are engaging with the clients at all. I know you were in the same room as them but that’s about it. Assuming that they are happy with their interactions with you, the other stakeholders (shadows and tutors) are currently well out of the loop and have no real understanding of what it is you are doing.

- Let me know when your next client meeting is and I’ll sit in.

- I like that you’re keeping a weekly reflection in the form of a report, this is a good start. But if you want to get a better mark in reflection you really need to be keeping a working feedback log and individual reflection log. Capturing individual reflection is a big part of this mark and right now you don’t have any mechanism to do that. Set these up and make peoples use of them a regular scheduled activity.

### Conclusion/Next Steps

- Agree with all. And we will have a group meeting and allocate relative tasks.
