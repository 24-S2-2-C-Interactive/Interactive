### Issue: Domain and permission issues with third party
**Details**:
The domain and ID permission issues, which require approval from ANU IT. Since the client is not familiar with the application process with ITS, our group will handle contacting ANU IT. The main challenge we faced was that no one knew how to address the third-party technical support involved in this project.To tackle this, I made an appointment with ANU ITS and sent emails to the relevant stakeholders.Feedback collection as below:

  Hosting on the CBE domain is not suitable for student projects because they may pose a security risk. He thinks student projects can't maintain the same level of security as official school applications.

- **Feedback**:
"My suggestion is that you first implement the website on your local computer and make sure everything including user authentication works. Then you can consider immigrating the website to CBE website and potentially using ANU authentication."

### Conclusion/Next Steps

- After trade-off, we consider using local development and discuss this issue with clients.
- Mark the Domain and ID with ITS as a risk in the future, we need to further discuss.
