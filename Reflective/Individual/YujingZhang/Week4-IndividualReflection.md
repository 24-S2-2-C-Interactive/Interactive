### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
- I revised the meeting template to improve how we conduct meetings. I added sections to record the meeting process and discussions, and moved tasks from the meeting to our project log. We also decided on the note-taker for the next meeting during this one, aiming to maximize the effectiveness of our meetings by addressing current and potential issues in one session. This should improve communication efficiency and reduce the frequency of meetings. Previously, we didn’t send out an agenda or assign a note-taker before meetings, which led to disorganized sessions. To fix this, I prepared an agenda in advance, took notes during the meeting, and updated the log at the same time. This reduced the time needed for post-meeting documentation since we have a lot of material to manage. I communicated and implemented this new method within the team, and both the team and the client adopted it in our recent meeting, with great results.
- I discussed with Jinghan about our project log and the dimensions we should track. We need to link meeting minutes and related documents to the log.
- On the technical side, I researched WordPress and identified potential risks of using a low-code platform.
- I analyzed client’s requirements and write a features document to help us discuss and finalize development tasks and prototype.
- I found a good Agile video tutorial and shared it on Teams to help us better understand the process. 
### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
Reflecting on this week, I learned the importance of proactively improving our processes. By gathering feedback from stakeholders and team members, I was able to enhance our communication flow and document management. This proactive approach allowed us to identify and solve issues quickly, which I believe significantly boosted our team’s efficiency and collaboration. Additionally, by applying the knowledge from the 6120 course on development processes, I was able to practically implement what I’ve learned about Agile like from the user stories to generate features. This experience has given me a deeper understanding of how these concepts work in real-world scenarios.
